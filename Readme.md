<h1>Sleeper Link Fantasy Football Discord Bot</h1>

Sleeper Link provides a link between your discord server and your Sleeper fantasy football league making it more conveinient to use Discord as your primary tool for league chat. It includes commands that return your league's matchups, rosters, point projections and auto updated roster transactions.

There is also a configurable news feed for all the latest and breaking NFL news from sources such as ESPN, Rotowire, and Yahoo as well as giving you the ability to search for the latest player news.

Sleeper Link is fully capable of handling different scoring settings (PPR, Half PPR & Standard) and allows you to add multiple leagues per server. Sleeper Link is in active development and more features are planned including League Table/Playoff bracket information, pick trades, waiver orders, injury information, draft information, a discord-based trade block, and live score updates.

Parts of Sleeper Link work without a Sleeper league, so if you use Yahoo, ESPN or NFL Fantasy Football for your league you can still access player news, player points projections and have the latest NFL news to your Discord server.
